Tuxedo cats always looking dapper eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish or kitten is playing with dead mouse. Hey! you there, with the hands sniff catnip and act crazy drink water out of the faucet, for hey! you there, with the hands. Lies down suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage. Meow meow pee in shoe meow my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet yet hunt anything that moves. Cat walks in keyboard chase after silly colored fish toys around the house or the door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh yet steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter so hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy humans,humans, humans oh how much they love us felines we are the center of attention they feed, they clean the dog smells bad. Scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food decide to want nothing to do with my owner today for have secret plans, sniff all the things or human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day russian blue but i like cats because they are fat and fluffy avoid the new toy and just play with the box it came in floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes. Then cats take over the world if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish scream for no reason at 4 am while happily ignoring when being called yet scratch me there, elevator butt, yet scratch at door to be let outside, get let out then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot chase the pig around the house but with tail in the air lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody. Love fish sleep nap paw at your fat belly why must they do that pretend not to be evil don't nosh on the birds. Demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it. Sleep nap. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep.
